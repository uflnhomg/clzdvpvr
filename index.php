A firm is a name under which enterprises (or their associations) act in economic activities as an independent economic entity.  All this and much more came to light during our joint excursions into our own depths.  So, the spouses unite their desires.  Consider the words of Joseph Addison [16]: “When I look at the graves of great men, all envy dies in me; when I read epitaphs to beauties, passion fades; when I see the grief of parents at the grave of their son, compassion tightens my heart; when I see the graves of the parents themselves, I realize the futility of grieving for those whom we too will soon follow; when I see how kings lie next to those who overthrew them, when I watch how former ideological opponents or righteous people, who split this world with their strife and discussions, rest side by side,- I think with sadness and surprise about the insignificance of rivalry, strife and discord in the life of mankind.  I get reactive.  And I found a certain pattern that is characteristic of almost all relationships, the center of which is the spouse.  And he knew how to do it.  Instead of a pain point, they became a source of joy and strength for both of them.  - But since you yourself are not talking specifically, I only have to act by exclusion.  But people often rely on sympathy, and this makes them addicted.  In order to recognize and develop them, in order to use them in accordance with our deepest needs, we must think differently, shift our paradigms to a new, deeper level - "from the inside out".  The strongest and highest motive that prompts us to do this is that it is necessary not only for us, but also for our descendants, the subsequent generations of all mankind. </em></q></p>
